20220203 - Renamed from DK-ClarinTools to texton-Java
           Password stored as SHA-256 encoded string. Default password is still
           empty string, but its SHA-256 encoded equivalent is not.

20210222   Split 'create' in three stages: upload, list workflows, chosen workflow

20200813   Added help page

20200414   Check whether solutions are likely to explode

20200304 - More memoization in workflow computation, with noticeable speed-up:
            * (old) fulfillable goal/source/tool combinations (memoized paths)
            * (new) unfulfillable goal/source/tool combinations
            * (new) unfulfillable goal/source combinations

20191119 - Added recognition of tab-separated input, with and without
           interspersed empty lines.

20191110 - Added parameter 'parms' to 'prunePipes'.
           Fixed error in function 'eliminate' that clipped and invalidated solutions.

20190815 - Changed response ContentType to "application/xhtml+xml" in several places.
           Changed & to &amp; in href address.

20190723 - Bring back the toolsUploadURL function.

20190514 - Removed information that orgmode input is unambiguous.

20190501 - Adapted title in html headers.

20190430 - Bluish colours. Background gradient set to "no-repeat"

20190414 - Fixed <body> inside another <body> 

20190311 - Changed !alts:(%?alt ?opts)+?alts 
           to      !alts:%(%?alt ?opts)+?alts
           due to change in bracmat.
           The old expression captures 0 in alt.
           The new expression captures values non-empty string <>0.

20190216 - '&' in local file name is replaced by '_'

20190123 - Fixed small problem with tool selection. 

20190104 - Added table 'zippedresults' that tells which results are still
           available. Each time https://cst.dk/tools/mypoll?job=2983 (where
           2983 is a job number) is called after the job has been finished,
           the service responds with sending a link to the zipfile with the
           results. These results are available for 48 hours (see
           deleteAfterMillisec in properties.xml). After that time, the zipfile
           is deleted, 'zippedresults' updated, and the response changes to
           a message saying that the results have been deleted.

20181221 - Fixed asynchronous processing. If a tool returns status code 202,
           the WMS starts the next job step. When the tool post the result
           with status code 201, the WMS starts a new thread to process the
           pipeline. Thus every time an asynchronous tool is called, an
           additional thread is added.
           Fixed the output listing.

20181212 - Fixed job queue: find every needed input, also if input is a
           combination of output(s) from previous steps and input uploaded by
           the user.

20181211 - Changed facet for diplom input from 'text' to 'token'.

20181207 - While yesterday's update made it possible to have a workflow with a
           step that takes the user's input in addition to input from another
           tool, today's update also sends all inputs to that step.
           Also looked at problems with aborting the execution of a workflow in
           the Windows test setup, which were found to be caused by the Bracmat
           JNI not being thread safe in Windows. This is now solved by using the
           C++ std::mutex implementation. 
           (See https://github.com/BartJongejan/Bracmat) 

20181206 - It was not possible to have a tool that had input from another tool
           and that also needed the input given by the user. Either a tool
           used the input from the user and nothing else, or a tool took input
           from other tools, and not from th user. This is now fixed. This
           makes it possible to have a tool that creates output that is
           identical to the input in all aspects, apart from annotations.

20181203 - Edited text on front page. Removed restriction to max 3 URLs.
           Increased max number of 'calls' from 10000 to 100000. 
           Changed colours and font, and some of the text.

20181128 - Exclude workflows with two or more steps that use the same tool
           with only minor differences: the same feature values, but different
           subspecifications of (some of) those values. For example, one step
           with tokeniser X that follows the Penn Treebank convention of
           splitting aren't isn't we'll in are n't is n't and we 'll, and one
           step with tokeniser X that does not follow those conventions.

20181122 - Fixed Intersection$. Some variables were undefined

20181113 - Better feed back to user when no workflows found.

20181109 - Set background colour to #F2EEE2, which is the same as the front
           page. Improved goal legend.

20181102 - Fixed printing full names of subspecifications.

20181101 - Fixed handling of value subspecifications.

20181030 - Added spec values to goal. Needs to be tested!

20181026 - Improved handling of underspecified input (which could be added
           as input to several steps, since the profile didn't mismatch).
           Added recognition for "diplom" files, which are files that have
           tables with 17 columns separated by vertical bars. 
           This requires Bracmat version 6.3, build 227 (27 August 2018)
           or newer. (get$<file> did not return an empty string if <file> was
           zero length.) 

20181024 - Added tool names after completed steps. Removed <tablename>= from
           the start of tables, making code somewhat faster. Also cached 
           serviced feature values, reducing pause after front page by some
           seconds.

20181023 - Added checkbox to indicate that goal is MINIMAL, i.e. that the user
           also wants to see similar workflows that deliver more than strictly
           required.

20181022 - Removed some stale code having to do with email. (The service does
           not send or receive emails.) Attempted to obtain wget's power by
           switching from java.net.HttpURLConnection to org.apache.http's 
           HttpClient. Since there was no improvement (not able to follow
           redirects when accessing
           https://www.lesoir.be/185755/article/2018-10-21/footbelgate-le-beerschot-wilrijk-jouera-contre-malines-sous-reserve)
           I decided to keep java.net.HttpURLConnection. Adapted functionality
           so user does not see inaccessible input.

20181020 - Fixed percolation of specs if the user did not specify any features,
           but restricted workflow solutions by specifying a tool with more
           than one incarnation. (Each incarnation can imply a different set
           of output specs).

20181019 - Fixed erreor in the way toolprop table is factorized before saving.

20181018 - Improved comment at start of toolsprog.bra. Removed save$ function
           since there is no use case for it. Improved importTables$ function
           so it doesn't end with calling exportTables$, which was harmless,
           but unnecessary and confusing.

20181017 - Made exporting and importing tables more clear. Use
           exportTables$[<filename>] and importTables$<filename>

20181004 - Removed dead code that had to do with production of CMDI-metadata
           for text resources. (Now superseded by TEI-metadata.)

20181001 - Changed text that appears when goal is underspecified and a tool is
           chosen. Show alphabetically sorted list of tools.

20180827 - Adapted path to pdffonts (/usr/local/bin/pdffonts). (By the way,
           this program is not available under windows.)

20180826 - Recognise input MIME type application/json.

20180826 - When only selecting a tool, this tool will always be last in the
           workflow. Also quit unfold function when number of solutions
           is going to explode.
           Added (guessed) values for input appearance: 'normal' or 'roman'.

20180820 - You can leave goal specs empty if you specify which tool to use.

20180818 - Added optional "workflow must include this tool"-field.

20180823 - "audio/wav" content type for files ending with ".wav"

20180821 - Clean up java code, added links to the input, the intermediary files
           and the output to the poll window.

20180815 - Clip xml declaration from spangrp file before embedding it in text
           element in TEI file.

20180813 - Improved unfoldTreeN$ to discard solutions that imply incompatible
           assumptions about input feature values. (Not all input features are
           necessarily fixed when workflows are computed.) Computation is
           generally faster and the results are cleaner.

20180810 - Pruned workflows with a tool that has multiple inputs that differ
           in more than one feature. (Features of inputs shall differ in
           one and only one feature, e.g. different formats or different
           languages, but not both.)

20180810 - Reduced max calls from 100000 to 10000

20180809 - Fixed error in fold$ function causing features being set to 0.
           The bug showed up when the output specified content type
           'noun phrases' and 'period' was only specified in the input.  

20180808 - Τοοl tips in the list of workflows.

20171125 - Skipped screen saying "Follow the status of job [##]".
           Fixed incorrect handling of input feature value with internal
		   structure, such as "txt^hq".

20170817 - Percolated unused features from the leafs (=input) to the root
           (=output). This made many tool invocations identical. This caused a
           further reduction in the number of distinct workflows. 

20170811 - Kicked out work flows that contain same tool more than once with
           same facets, only differing in subspecification of facets. But first
           it is attempted to harmonize these instances by adding
           subspecifications where necessary and possible. 

20170512 - Recognize TEI input
